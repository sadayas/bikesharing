## Summary

To Conclude:
  The creation of a bicycle sharing profram in Des Moines would be desireable in the city. In our data, we can see that a people will indeed use the program.  Whether if its for basic transportation, or a subscription for the daily work week, a bike sharing program will be profitable in a city.  In our data, we are able to see that many of the bicycles were used at the start of the day (7am) and at the end of the day (6pm).  This would become a cheaper alternative for workers who live within the city.  In the work week, an average of 30k+ bicycle shares occur - which although many bicycles are used, there is down time to repair the most needy ones.
